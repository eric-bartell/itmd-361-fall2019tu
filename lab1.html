  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Eric Bartell. I'm a fourth-year Digital Humanities major from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I'm taking this class to finish out my CS requirements. <br />
  I actually started out as a CompSci major, and self-taught myself HTML in early 2017. I haven't touched it since, though, so I'm pretty rusty. <br />
  Looking forward to the class!</p>
